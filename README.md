# metacog_game
This repository contains code and subject data for an experiment I ran on metacognition and language.  Metacognition refers to one's evaluation of one's own cognitve processes e.g. learning. In the experiment, subjects were told to shoot aliens in a video game.

Requires python 2.7, pygame, pandas, psychopy, and pyo.  Versions of modules would have been up to date as of last commit, I cannot guarantee compatiblity with most recent versions

To run the game, type 

    python run_games.py
